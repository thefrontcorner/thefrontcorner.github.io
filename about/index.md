Hello, I’m Amina.  I am an entrepreneur, facilitator, coach, seeker of stories,
and curious mind at large.

In 2009 I founded The Front Corner while living in San Francisco to investigate
the universal yet distinctly unique processes underlying our creativity, the
‘creative process’, so to speak.  I’m deeply curious about people and the
forces that encourage us to experience aliveness in our body, creative flow,
and orientation among chaos.  This lens of creativity and process gives me a
framework for inquiring.

The main ethos behind The Front Corner is that the creative process is a
connective force.  It’s our ability to resource from the far corners of our
lives: our thoughts and emotions, ancient wisdom, memories and fragments --
everything we’ve collected from being alive to this world and combine these
pieces in novel ways, creating something decidedly new.  We can create anew
from the most unsuspecting sources of inspiration; our dreams and others’
dreams, in the iterations born of experimentation, the gaps between the
generations that have timeless process in common even when the content has
changed.


A practice of mining to the core of our creative process is an important
inquiry of personal and collective activism.  This activism occurs when what
was not yet speech ripe becomes a little more ripe or unlikely alliances are
created that alter the lens in which we see and act in the world.   Let us slow
down together and explore this mysterious edge dwelling process, with no
destination to arrive and many discoveries to make along the way.
