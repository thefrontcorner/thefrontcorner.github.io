The Front Corner, based out of Paris, wants to be a part of films that
challenge the norm, invoke questions, cross generations and borders, and
artistically inspire. The creative process is at the heart of the organization,
as understanding and aligning these distinct forces is paramount in any
creative endeavor, including filmmaking. 

The Front Corners' first production is in collaboration with Academy Award
Nominated Director, Judith Ehrlich, on political documentary 'The Mouse That
Roared'. The film takes us behind world-changing headlines to the people who
risk everything in order to redefine freedom of speech and the right to privacy
in an increasingly surveilled world.
